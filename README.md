## 👋 Bonjour!

I'm a data scientist with background in digital media advertising, grown in several agencies and at Google, and currently working for a ridesharing company.

## 💻 My current tech stack for data science

- Hardware: **Macbook Pro 13"** with Intel i5, 16GB RAM and 256GB HDD – and a pair of Airpods
- IDE: **Visual Studio Code** with as few extensions as possible (includes *Markdown All in One*, *Rainbow CSV* and *SQLTools*)
- Python package manager: **Miniconda**, with the essential libraries (*pandas* is obviously #1, and usual suspects include *seaborn*, *NumPy*, *SQLAlchemy* and Google Cloud libraries)
- Notebooks: **Jupyterlab** on local machine, but also increasingly on Google Cloud-hosted notebooks
- Database: **BigQuery** is my preferred analytical data warehouse, for its fast performance whatever the dataset size, and for interactive queries debugging
- Versioning: **Github**, switching from Gitlab, for its pixel-perfect UI and powerful new features like Codespaces
- File storage: **Google Drive** with desktop sync
